All files are in the "ITWORKS" folder
To run this program, compile shell.java:

 $ javac shell.java

Once compiled, the program can be run with the format of 
"java shell <input .txt file> <output.txt file>".
The input .txt file must be in the same directory as shell.java 
and the output .txt file will be written in the same directory
with the name specified.

As an example, the following will generate a file called
output.txt if sample.txt is a valid set of constraints:

 $ java shell sample.txt output.txt
